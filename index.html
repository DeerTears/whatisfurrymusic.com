                    Furry Music is anything that wants to call itself "Furry Music". It is also a booming scene of niche musicians who publish, perform, and create music as members of the furry community

                        Hi!, my name is Emberlynn Bland (she/they prononus). My mission is to catalogue and understand the many subcommunities of furry music, and to appreciate works by DIY artists in the online space. I ask "what is furry music?" to find unique perspectives, voices, and sounds through the furry community.

                [Furry music] doesn't necessarily have to be exclusive to the fandom, but in terms of where the artist is promoting their stuff ... it feels like the label is more fulfilled if they're active in furry spaces.

            <div class="section">
                <p>A common misconception is that furry music is mostly one (or two) genres, due to the popularity of
                    certain artists in both furry culture and greater nerd culture.</p>
                <p>You don't have to look far to find music that isn't breakcore, dance music, or comedy rock.</p>
                <p>Take a look at this chart of genres made by furries, sampling <b>567</b> furry musicians:</p>
                <img src="images/genre-count.PNG"
                    alt="A list of genres and the count of musicians found making that genre. Each genre has a description of subgenres included. Here are the numbers for each genre: Ambient - 12. Classical - 30. Electronic - 205. Experimental - 21. Funk - 3. Hip-hop - 31. Jazz - 4. Metal - 38. Pop - 69. Rnb - 2. Rock - 99. Singer-songwriter 24. Various - 26." />
                <img src="images/genre-graph.PNG"
                    alt="A pie graph showing the above data as percentages. Electronic is at 36.3%, Rock at 17.6%, Pop at 12.2%, Metal at 6.7%, Hip-hop at 5.5%, Classical at 5.3%, Various at 4.6%, Singer-songwriter at 4.3%, Experimental at 3.7%, all others are too small to be given a label on the chart." />
                <p>Electronic, Rock, and Pop seem to be the most popular categories of music made by furries, each
                    reigning over 12% of the listed furry musicians. Other genres like Metal, Hip-hop, Classical, and
                    Singer-songwriter all have established niches in the furry music scene.</p>
                <p>The primary difference between Electronic and Pop (for this chart) was if the music predominantly
                    featured original vocals. If it was instrumental, or featured rough vocal sampling, it was assigned
                    as Electronic.</p>
                <p>More is being done to help make this genre information meaningful, looking at clarifying what makes
                    up Electronic music in the furry fandom, and being on the lookout for communities not yet uncovered
                    in lesser-known genres.</p>
