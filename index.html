    <h2>What makes a musician "furry"?</h2>
    <p>"Furry music" is not an easy definition. Many people have different opinions on what constitutes "furry music". To me, it seems suggested by one of many attributes:
    <ul class="toc">
        <li>Visual use of anthropomorphic characters</li>
        <li>Furry convention presence</li>
        <li>Fursuit performances</li>
        <li>Furry community involvement</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Furry characters</h3>
    <p>Some musicians use an anthropomorphic character, or "fursona" as an online identity with their music.</p>
    <p>To name <em>only</em> a few, this includes artists like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ashley Ninelives</li>
        <li>Tenkitsune</li>
        <li>kendall :3</li>
        <li>russelbuck</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Furry convention presence</h3>
    <p>Some bands perform at furry conventions and furry events as their first choice of venue. This includes artists
        like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rhythm Bastard</li>
        <li>Trio Menagerie</li>
        <li>Full Color</li>
        <li>E Royale</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fursuit performances</h3>
    <p>Although not required, some artists wear a "fursuit" of their character on stage during their music performances.
        This includes artists like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I've Made Too Much Pasta</li>
        <li>Fly To The Night</li>
        <li>Fons the Bun</li>
        <li>Para Raccoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Furry community involvement</h3>
    <p>Some musicians may not appear furry on the surface, but regularly engage with the community as a place to perform
        and find community. This includes artists like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jaylaflame</li>
        <li>$uDO.NORMI</li>
        <li>$leazy EZ (FENDIHOOSKIE)</li>
        <li>Michael Cera Palin</li>
        <li>Sarah and The Safeword</li>
    </ul>
