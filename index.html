<h1>what is furry music?</h1>
<p>Furry music is anything that wants to call itself "furry music".
</p>
<p>
    Right now there is a booming scene of musicians who use their furry identity as the catalyst to creation.
</p>
<p>
    By asking "what is furry music", I try to find the unique voice and sounds that these artists have.
</p>
<p>
    I'm always looking for the most outstanding, unique, undoubtedly furry music.
