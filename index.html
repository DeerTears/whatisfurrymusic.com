    <h2 id="genres">Genres</h2>
    <div class="section">
    <p>A common misconception is that furry music is mostly one (or two) genres, due to the popularity of certain artists in both furry culture and greater nerd culture.</p>
    <p>You don't have to look far to find music that isn't breakcore, dance music, or comedy rock.</p>
    <p>Take a look at this chart of genres made by furries, sampling <b>567</b> furry musicians:</p>
    <img src="images/genre-count.PNG" alt="A list of genres and the count of musicians found making that genre. Each genre has a description of subgenres included. Here are the numbers for each genre: Ambient - 12. Classical - 30. Electronic - 205. Experimental - 21. Funk - 3. Hip-hop - 31. Jazz - 4. Metal - 38. Pop - 69. Rnb - 2. Rock - 99. Singer-songwriter 24. Various - 26."/>
    <img src="images/genre-graph.PNG" alt="A pie graph showing the above data as percentages. Electronic is at 36.3%, Rock at 17.6%, Pop at 12.2%, Metal at 6.7%, Hip-hop at 5.5%, Classical at 5.3%, Various at 4.6%, Singer-songwriter at 4.3%, Experimental at 3.7%, all others are too small to be given a label on the chart."/>
    <p>Electronic, Rock, and Pop seem to be the most popular categories of music made by furries, each reigning over 12% of the listed furry musicians. Other genres like Metal, Hip-hop, Classical, and Singer-songwriter all have established niches in the furry music scene.</p>
    <p>The primary difference between Electronic and Pop (for this chart) was if the music predominantly featured original vocals. If it was instrumental, or featured rough vocal sampling, it was assigned as Electronic.</p>
    <p>More is being done to help make this genre information meaningful, looking at clarifying what makes up Electronic music in the furry fandom, and being on the lookout for communities not yet uncovered in lesser-known genres.</p>

    <h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
    <p>This information is slightly outdated, but gives a general gist of where this data is coming from.</p>
<div class="section">
    <img src="images/location-count.PNG"/>
    <img src="images/location-graph.PNG"/>
    <p>The majority of artists I've catalogued are from the United States, or do not list a country/location on their public profiles.</p>
