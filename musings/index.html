            <h2>what makes a musician "furry"?</h2>
            <div class="section">
            <p>I think at it's core, the "furriness" of a musician comes down to community involvement.</p>
            <p>Furry is already a pretty strongly established type of community, with many regional and internet-based communities that take on similar furry ideas. Anthropomorphic animals are ultimately a memetic idea that have arisen naturally, both in history and independently when it comes to the world of producing media.</p>
            <p>So sure, anyone can be a furry. Anyone can call themselves a furry. And I don't think there's anything particular that should bar someone from adapting that label. They don't need a fursuit, a fursona, furry art on their albums, or to have played at cons. These are all indicators that a musician is in the furry community, sure. But I feel like gatekeeping furriness by an arbitrary metric short of saying "I am comfortable with being called a furry" is merely room for disagreement.</p>
            <p>My goal with posing this question to people, "what is furry music", is to celebrate the unique, often overlooked creativity that comes out of the furry community, from the most popular convention acts to the newly-minted bandcamp pages.</p>
            <p>I think furry music would be boring if it was entirely about appearances. I think fellow furries have overlooked the musicians in the fandom because it's easy to hear one song from a furry musician, and the novelty of "it's music but done by a furry" wears off.</p>
            <p>What has ignited my interest in furry music is seeing people go above and beyond incorporating their sense of furry identity into the music. Here are some lyrical topics that I think furry musicians cover handily when compared with other non-furry artists.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Queerness</li>
                <li>Therianthropy (being an animal)</li>
                <li>Long distance relationships</li>
                <li>Genuine feelings of community</li>
                <li>Celebration of kink communities</li>
                <li>Sexual liberation</li>
                <li>Feelings of otherness</li>
                <li>Familial/relationship trauma</li>
                <li>Social isolation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not all furry music has to convey any of these feelings. In fact, most of it doesn't. A significant amount of furry music is instrumental, with song titles that don't evoke these above themes. But it's a really common element to the point where, after having studied over 700 furry musicians, I have subjectively found these topics come up often.</p>
            <p>This is where my interest in indie furry music comes from, as it's most likely to be about these above feelings, and their many intersections when considered as one of hundreds of experiences lived through one's life.</p>

            <h2>therian music vs. furry music</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <p>Therian Music and Furry Music are both great! I feel like both cases of "music serving an identity" are valid, and there is absolutely some overlap between these two categories.</p>
                <p>Music that defines itself as Therian similarly, does not have to convey only therian ideas. It's enough to create works with the heart of a specific identity or experience. But it has the unique opportunity to use its medium as a way to convey uniquely therian ideas and experiences through song.</p>
                <p>I definitely blur the line a bit when talking about furry ideals when really, I feel like there's elements of therian ideas that work their way into furry art. For music with therian ideas, this could be lyrics that never mention the singer's corporeal form, lyrics that reinforce an animal nature upon its narrator or a subject. Animal sounds being more prominent than human sounds.</p>
                <p>From talking with some of my friends who are prominent in modern therian communities, therianthropy has had a negative history within the furry community. I wish nothing but the best for therians, and I really hope furry matures to be a safer place for therian communities to develop.</p>

            <h2>why are controversial furry musicians on your list?</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <p>My focus is on history and archiving works. I'd rather let you, the reader, decide what is right and not right to consume.</p>
                <p>The HUGE list is not a recommendation portal. It is a list that helps track our online history and serves as a hub for finding new furry music. It is beyond my ability to effectively evaluate the character and worldview of every artist on the list.</p>
