<h1 class="title">What makes something furry?</h1>
<sub class="date">2024-03-14</sub>
<p>
  "Furry music" is not an easy definition. Many people have different opinions
  on what constitutes "furry music". To me, it seems suggested by one of many
  attributes:
</p>
<ul class="toc">
  <li>Visual use of anthropomorphic characters</li>
  <li>Furry convention presence</li>
  <li>Fursuit performances</li>
  <li>Furry community involvement</li>
</ul>
<h3>Furry characters</h3>
<p>
  Some musicians use an anthropomorphic character, or "fursona" as an online
  identity with their music.
</p>
<p>To name <em>only</em> a few, this includes artists like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ashley Ninelives</li>
  <li>Tenkitsune</li>
  <li>kendall :3</li>
  <li>scuttlefuzz</li>
  <li>1 Trait Danger</li>
</ul>
<h3>Furry convention presence</h3>
<p>
  Some bands perform at furry conventions and furry events as their first choice
  of venue. This includes artists like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jaylaflame</li>
  <li>$uDO.NORMI</li>
  <li>$leazy EZ (FENDIHOOSKIE)</li>
  <li>Rhythm Bastard</li>
  <li>Trio Menagerie</li>
  <li>Full Color</li>
  <li>E Royale</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fursuit performances</h3>
<p>
  Although not required, some artists wear a "fursuit" of their character on
  stage during their music performances. This includes artists like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I've Made Too Much Pasta</li>
  <li>Fly To The Night</li>
  <li>Fons the Bun</li>
  <li>Para Raccoon</li>
</ul>
<h3>Furry community involvement</h3>
<p>
  Some musicians may not appear furry on the surface, but regularly engage with
  the community as a place to perform and find community. This includes artists
  like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>glass beach</li>
  <li>Michael Cera Palin</li>
  <li>Sarah and The Safeword</li>
</ul>
